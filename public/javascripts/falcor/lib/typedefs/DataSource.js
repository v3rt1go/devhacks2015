/**
 * A DataSource is an interface which can be implemented to expose JSON Graph information to a Model. Every DataSource is associated with a single JSON Graph object. Models execute JSON Graph operations (get, set, and call) to retrieve values from the DataSourceâ€™s JSON Graph object. DataSources may retrieve JSON Graph information from anywhere, including device memory, a remote machine, or even a lazily-run computation.
